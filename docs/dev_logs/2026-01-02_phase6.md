# Work Log 2026-01-02 (Phase 6 MVP)
- Scope: Phase 6 MVP finish (docs, analytics no-op, light E2E, Lighthouse, screenshots, release guide).
- Change: README + docs/TEST_PROCEDURE updated with Docker-only Playwright command (v1.57.0) and node_modules volume note.
- Change: docker-compose.yml frontend uses named volume `frontend_node_modules` for /app/node_modules.
- Change: frontend analytics no-op added; track() wired in Search/SakeDetail/Favorites/Recent/useFavorites.
- Change: Playwright config + smoke test added; CI runs `pnpm exec playwright` with browser install.
- Change: backend/alembic.ini script_location aligned for Docker.
- Test: Playwright Docker v1.57.0-jammy (1 passed).
- Test: Frontend lint/typecheck/build in Docker (pass).
- Test: Backend pytest + seed in Docker (5 passed).
- Issue: Vite import error for @tanstack/react-query due to missing node_modules; fixed via named volume + pnpm install in same compose.
- Issue: Playwright "command not found" resolved by CLI direct call (node node_modules/@playwright/test/cli.js).
- Pending: Manual browser verification, Lighthouse report, screenshots, release guide update.
