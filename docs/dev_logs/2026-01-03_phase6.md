# Work Log 2026-01-03 (Phase 6 MVP)
- Scope: Phase 6 MVP stabilization (E2E, Lighthouse CI, documentation).
- Change: E2E uses `seedFavoritesInPage` + `waitForFavoriteInIdb` to seed IndexedDB `favorite_sake` deterministically.
- Change: Screenshots test navigates via SPA links (Search -> Favorites) to avoid PWA offline fallback during screenshots.
- Change: Lighthouse CI config updated to wait for preview readiness and assert PWA audits compatible with Lighthouse v12.
- Change: Added meta description in `frontend/index.html` to improve SEO score.
- Doc: Added `docs/DOCS_MASTER_RULES.md` and linked from README.
- Test: Not run (log/doc update only).

# Work Log 2026-01-09 (Phase 6 MVP)
- Scope: GitHub Actions Lighthouse CI fix.
- Change: Added `preset: 'lighthouse:no-pwa'` to `lighthouserc.cjs` to disable PWA category assertions (deprecated in Lighthouse v12).
- Change: Removed `audits:installable-manifest` and `audits:service-worker` assertions as they are no longer needed.
- Reason: `@lhci/cli@0.14.0` uses Lighthouse v12 where `categories.pwa` was removed, causing `auditRan: 0` failures.
- Change: Reverted `preset: 'lighthouse:no-pwa'` and added `'categories:pwa': 'off'` instead to avoid enabling all recommended audits by preset.
- Change: Added `frontend/public/robots.txt` to fix SEO audit failure for robots.txt.

# Work Log 2026-01-10 (Phase 6 MVP)

- Test: Frontend lint/typecheck/build passed.
